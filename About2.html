                <img src="MassageTherapistMatthewPosey.jpg" alt="Picture of Matthew Posey">
                
                    <h3>My name is Matthew Posey and I am a professional massage therapist with 10 years 
                        of experience. I am excited to announce that I am now creating my own private 
                        practice to help pay my way through college and continue my education in computer 
                        science. <br><br>

                        My area of expertise is deep tissue massage. I believe that deep tissue massage is 
                        one of the most effective ways to target specific areas of muscle tension and 
                        pain, and I am dedicated to providing my clients with the highest quality massage 
                        services to help them feel their best. <br><br>
                        
                        One thing that sets me apart from other massage therapists is that I have essential 
                        tremors, which cause my hands to be in a constant state of gentle vibration. I like 
                        to say that this makes me born to be a massage therapist! I believe that my condition 
                        is beneficial to how I work with the muscles. My tremor allows me to be more sensitive 
                        to the client's needs and helps me to provide a more effective massage. <br><br>
                        
                        I understand that everyone's needs are different, and I will work with you to create a
                        personalized massage experience that addresses your specific needs and concerns. 
                        Whether you're looking for relaxation, stress relief, or relief from pain and muscle 
                        tension, I am here to help. <br><br>
                        
                        Thank you for considering my massage services. I look forward to working with you and 
                        helping you to feel your best.</h3><br>
